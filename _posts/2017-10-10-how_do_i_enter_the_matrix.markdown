Red pill of blue pill? Truth or fantasy? Pain or pleasure? I've always pondered on that question growing up. Of course, we all want to be astronauts or princesses, but - of course - reality comes to nip us in the butt. For me, web development was sort of a wake up call. I had spent most of my teenage years (and the majority of my twenties) partying. What was life without a bottle of $10.00 booze and a cohort of women. Pretty pathetic right? I had yet to find a niche in life. I was living day to day, hoping for the best and expecting the worst. Well, life changed. 

Remember Thomas Anderson (aka "Neo")?  He believed a man named Morpheus could provide him answers to his question of "What is The Matrix", yet before he gets the chance to meet him, he is  apprehended by the Agents at the beginning of the movie. Big uh oh right there. The whole plea bargain for Morpheus' life just didn't sit too well. That was me. I was lost. I had questions and I thought I knew a few people with answers. Unfortunately, before I got the chance to ask, I too spent the night in jail. That's where I learned the true value of intelligence. 

It was cold. I mean... cold cold. Everybody was shaking (as we had to strip out of everything that wasn't colored white and wear essentially a hospital gown). I'd shoot for an estimate of around 55 degrees fahrenheit in there. It was **not** fun. I mean, how can they do that to another human being? I was determined to never let it happen to me again. I was far too intelligent to make that a life pattern. So, what did I do? Google. I Googled everything from "$50k+" to "live anywhere in the world" to "work with people." It was funny, software and web developers kept popping up on that list. Personally, I was looking for some form of a sales job. I mean, I'm great with people! No. Not sales my father would keep saying. Always "code, code, code." I remembered that Proverbs always talked about listening to your father's word and never forsaking it. I figured, eh, what I was doing wasn't working out. Let's give it a shot. 

My first experience was through https://www.khanacademy.org/. Honestly, a truly amazing one at that. I began with bits of HTML5 and CSS3. I was instantly hooked. The fact that I was allowed unlimited creative control over a domain was utterly fascinating. Turning a completely blank page into something beautiful. That, that was art. I was head over heels. After finishing the course I was hungry for more. Talking about "code" literally made me smile. For weeks I was grinning ear to ear. I felt as if I finally found a future. I began scouting for more and more classes and ended up taking a great one written by a Canadian by the name of Brad Hussey at https://www.udemy.com/. Best part? It was a $200 course I got for $10 after a few coupon codes. **I was in!** 

Roughly two months went by before I finished the course. I had learned the basics of Bootstrap, WordPress, jQuery & jQuery-UI, and JavaScript. I felt I needed more though. I had my text-editor (Brackets) and some knowledge to kick everything into high gear. However, I felt like I was just missing something. So off I went again, scouting and scowering for bootcamps until I ran across Flat Iron Schools. One interview and twenty minutes of nerd and they were convinced I was material. Again, **I was in!** So here the real journey to a lucrative Web Development career begins. Fingers crossed everybody... and wish me luck!
