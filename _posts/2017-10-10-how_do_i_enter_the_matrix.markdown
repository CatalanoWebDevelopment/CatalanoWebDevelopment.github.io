Red pill of blue pill? Truth or fantasy? Pain or pleasure? I've always pondered on that question growing up. Of course, we all want to be astronauts or princesses, but - obviously - reality comes to nip us in the butt. For me, web development was sort of a wake up call. I had spent most of my younger years hunting for bugs and asking questions. I was infatuated with Bill Nye (the Science Guy) and had an obsessive yearning to know the answer to **every** quandary in life. I thought I was destined to work for NASA or some entymology research center. 

Nope! As I grew up, I found myself scared to let out that "inner geek." However, I was still always talking, talking, talking! This lead me into a career in sales. Everything from food to Ferraris (literally). I was selling. I was good. I was unfulfilled. I figured, man - I am way too smart for this. Every sales guy seemed to have some issue or another. Drugs, promiscuity, yada yada. Car sales, right? Not for me. I need to exercise my mind. You could only ask so many questions about a Porsche you know... 

So, what did I do? Google. I Googled everything from "$50k+" to "live anywhere in the world" to "work with people." It was funny, software and web developers kept popping up on that list. Personally, I was looking for some form of a pharmaceutical sales job (something actually requiring some IQ points). I mean, I'm great with people! No. Not sales my father would keep saying. Always "code, code, code." I remembered that Proverbs always talked about listening to your father's word and never forsaking it. I figured, eh, what I was doing wasn't working out. Let's give it a shot. 

My first experience was through https://www.khanacademy.org/. Honestly, a truly amazing one at that. I began with bits of HTML5 and CSS3. I was instantly hooked. The fact that I was allowed unlimited creative control over a domain was utterly fascinating. Turning a completely blank page into something beautiful. That, that was art. I was head over heels. After finishing the course I was hungry for more. Talking about "code" literally made me smile. For weeks I was grinning ear to ear. I felt as if I finally found a future. I began scouting for more and more classes and ended up taking a great one written by a Canadian by the name of Brad Hussey at https://www.udemy.com/. Best part? It was a $200 course I got for $10 after a few coupon codes. **I was in!** 

Roughly two months went by before I finished the course. I had learned the basics of Bootstrap, WordPress, jQuery & jQuery-UI, and JavaScript. I felt I needed more though. I had my text-editor (Brackets) and some knowledge to kick everything into high gear. However, I felt like I was just missing something. So off I went again, scouting and scowering for bootcamps until I ran across Flat Iron Schools. One interview and twenty minutes of nerd and they were convinced I was material. Again, **I was in!** So here the real journey to a fulfilling Web Development career begins. Fingers crossed everybody... and wish me luck!
